Environmental Monitoring Car 🚗🌍
This project features a compact environmental monitoring car built using the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller. Equipped with various environmental sensors, the car collects real-time data and provides remote control capabilities through a user-friendly website.

🌟 Features
Environmental Monitoring:

Sensors for noise, temperature, light, and dust.
Real-time data displayed on an OLED screen.
Remote Control:

Car can move forward, backward, left, and right.
Controlled via a custom-built web interface.
Data Logging:

Real-time sensor data is uploaded to a spreadsheet for record-keeping and analysis.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi RP2040
Sensors: Noise, temperature, light, and dust sensors
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web control)
Backend: Python (for data processing and control)
OLED Display: For showing real-time data
Spreadsheet Integration: For storing sensor data
📋 How It Works
Setup:

Assemble the car with sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi RP2040.
Ensure the OLED display and motors are correctly connected.
Control:

Access the control panel through the provided web interface.
Navigate the car using directional buttons.
Data Display and Storage:

Sensor data is shown in real-time on the OLED screen.
Data is simultaneously uploaded to a connected spreadsheet for logging.
